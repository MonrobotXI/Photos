Monrobot XI Computer
by donaldcaselli

The Monrobot XI computer was designed and built by the Monroe Calculator
Co. in Orange, New Jersey in 1959. In 1967 Computer Property Corporation
was formed and one purpose was to purchase all rights to the Monrobot XI
computer and continue to maintain existing installations, which numbered
350 across the USA and a few elsewhere, as well as maintain the
hardware. Systems Design, Inc. was a software company that was already
in operation, formed by Peter George Petropolis. He was writing
applications for the back office operations of stocks and bonds as well
as other industries. Systems Design, Inc. and Computer Property Corp.
maintained offices on West Street in Hanover Township, New Jersey
starting in September, 1967 and continued until closing in February,
1974. Computer Property Corp.  also had offices at One Maiden Lane in
New York City at that time.  List Management, Inc. in Rye, New York was
another CPC operation.  I worked at the Monroe Calculator Co. and then
continued with Systems Design, Inc. totaling nine years working with the
Monrobot XI computer.
